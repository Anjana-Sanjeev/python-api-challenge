# Summary of WeatherPy


* For this analysis the OpenWeatherMap API key was used along with citipy to find the different weather parameters (maximum temperature, humidity, cloudiness and wind speed) of random cities within a latitude and longitude range.


* Scatter plot and linear regression model was plotted to find the correlation between the latitude of the cities and the different weather parameters.


# Summary of VacationPy


* Using the cities cvs file created from the WeatherPy script, a map visualization is created for every city with respect to humidity.


* Then ideal weather cities are selected and using Geoapify API key, the the first hotel located within 10,000 metres of the coordinates are found. Then again a map visualization is created which shows the hotel name as well.
